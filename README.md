# RedM No Pixel Style Hud 
This is a No Pixel style hud for RedM. This work is from DuckyQ known as duck_hud. This hud has already been coded to work with ml_needs, you will no longer see the ml_needs hud underneath the No Pixel style hud!


Things added to the hud

    In Game Time (clock) to the end of the hud system

    Changed the colour of the green health bar to suit RedM better.

More will be added to this hud soon.


This hud comes with ml_needs and nas_hud inside. Just drag and drop the files in your resources folder and make sure the server.cfg looks like this.

```
ensure ml_needs
ensure nas_hud
```
